### General

WIFI is only available in ap mode, sta mode is not implemented :-/
The WIFI IP is 10.98.32.1, port is 80
The WIFI Default Password is 12345678

WIFI is disabled when enabling USB Networking (via camera LCD -Settings -USB Networking -ON) 
The USB RDNIS IP of the camera is 192.168.168.1
To connect to it via USB you will need to connect the camera to your PC and configure the PC's USB port with an IP address 192.168.168.2 /255.255.255.0
The easiest way to do this is on a linux machine. in ubuntu network dialog, look for wired icon with two arrows,click on Options... add Static IP
IP Address of 192.168.168.2/255.255.255.0 with a default gateway of 192.168.168.1
not necessary: use lsusb to find the hardware address of usb port after plugging in camera(usb port gets a new hardware address each time camera gets plugged in)
find that hardware address in network manager (ubuntu) 
not all USB cables will work, so try a different cable if the camera is not found after plugging it in

telnet port is open
login is root / no password 
file system is read only permission
If you want to change the write permission, try this line
mount -o remount,rw devtempfs /
After making fs writeable, be careful making changes - you can brick the camera.
to recover from bricking, copy the E1fw.bin firmware onto sd card root, then use notepad++ to create a file named autoexec.ash like this :
###########
firmfl prog c:\E1fw.bin

###########
note the blank line immediately below firmfl prog c:\E1fw.bin.. last line in the file must be blank to work..
Then the camera will flash a valid firmware and boot again. 
You must eject your sd card as soon as you read 'update complete' or something like that on the small LCD display. 
If not ejected, the flash process will start again.

The interface is based on HTTP, most of the request is GET. The format of response is (mostly!) JSON <br>

The format of request is：
	
	http://{ip}:{port}/*?param1={p1}[&parame2={p2}]

    
Response:
	
	{
        "code":0                <-- 0:OK, non 0: NG
        "desc":"demo"
        ... other data
    }

### Query the basic info of camera.
http://10.98.32.1/info // You can verify if the HTTP is ok or not.

	{
		"model":"Demo",			// model of camera
		"sw":"0.0.1"			// fw version

### Session
http://10.98.32.1/ctrl/session[?action=quit]

http://10.98.32.1/ctrl/* interface is for controlling the camera. Only one client can control the camera at the same time. The client own the session can control the camera, otherwise, HTTP status code is 409.</br>


	action=quit, quit current session
	/ctrl/session without arg means heart beat.

** We suggest the App owns the session when it's in foreground**
How is a session started?

            Every request in /ctrl/* will start a session, unless it return 409 in the status code.
            If you want to give up the owner ship, you can call /ctrl/session?action=quit
            And you can keep the session alive with a call /ctrl/session in every 30s

How is the session represented, a token?

            It's base on IP. You don't need to put it in your request.

How does a client know if there is an existing active session?

            If you access he /ctrl/* interface and the status code in HTTP header is 409, it means the camera is owned by other client.

Camera focus area can be changed by http interface </br>
http://10.98.32.1/ctrl/af?pos={index}

	pos=index, index is 32 bits int, high 16 bits is for X, low 16 bits is for Y.
	We mark the camera preview into X(Y) (X direction and Y direction) evenly by 16 in each line.
	When you mark a certain point X(Y) as 1, you set the point as your focus area.

    In the 16 x 16 matrix, X(Y),  all of the points you set as focus area should be in a rectangle and should be continuous. 

e.g.</br>
pos = ((0x6<<16) | 0x003c represents that (1,2) on the X direction and (2,3,4,5) on the Y direction consist the focus area (2x4=8 points in total).

###Streaming
The server address is 10.98.32.1 and port is 9876. It's a TCP based server.<br>
Fetch one frame:<br>
1. send 0x01(1 byte) to server to request one frame.<br>
2. recv data (4 byte payload len + following the frame data)<br>
3. repeat the step1/step2 to get more frames.<br>

Data format in payload:<br>
Each payload of the data is H.264 encoded data. If the fps is 30, you can get 30 H.264 data in one second.
